# README

This is the skeleton code for the 2017 Fall ECE408 / CS483 course project.
In this project, you will get experience with practical neural network artifacts, face the challenges of modifying existing real-world code, and demonstrate command of basic CUDA optimization techniques.
Specifically, you will get experience with

* Managing a simple machine-learning dataset.
* Using, profiling, and modifying MxNet a standard open-source neural-network framework.

You will demonstrate your CUDA expertise by

* Implementing an optimized neural network layer
* merged layer
* fp16
* anything else?

The project will be broken up into 3 milestones

## Milestone 1: Getting Started Due ()


## Milestone 2: A New Layer in MxNet

## Final Submission: An optimized layer

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.
